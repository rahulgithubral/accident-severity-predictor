# 🚑 Accident Severity Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **severity of road accidents** (Slight, Serious, or Fatal) using real-world crash data. It applies multiple machine learning models and compares their performance to identify the most accurate classifier.

> ✅ Built as part of a team project. This version was prepared and published individually for portfolio and resume use.
